# Number Guessing Game 

## Project Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a basic game that you play on your computer. You have to guess a number and you only get to try a few times. After each guess the game tells you if your guess is too high or too low. The Number Guessing Game is really easy to use. It is a great way for people who are new to programming to learn about things like loops and conditionals and how to get input from the user. The Number Guessing Game is a game for beginners because it is interactive and it helps people understand basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals and user input, in the Number Guessing Game.

## Purpose of the Project

The main purpose of this project is to:

- Teach fundamental programming concepts in C.

- Demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and variables.

- Provide a fun and interactive way to practice logical thinking and problem-solving.

## Utility

This game can be used for a lot of things like

* learning stuff

1. Having fun with friends and family

it is really good, for the game itself to be used for these things because the game can be used for entertainment and education so people can use the game for this purpose. The game can be used for other things too such as the game can be used for relaxation and the game can be used for socializing because the game is a game that people can play together and the game can be used for the game to be enjoyed by people who play the game.

- Learning and practicing C programming basics.

- Improving logical thinking and reasoning skills.

- If you are new to this and you want to have some fun with interactive programs there is entertainment for beginners, like you who want to try these simple interactive programs.

- Serving as a foundation for creating more advanced games in the future.


## How to Play

1. Run the program using a C compiler.

2. When you start the game it will show you a message and tell you how many attempts the game will give you. The game will also show you the number of attempts you have to play the game.

3. Enter your guesses one by one.

4. The game is going to help you out by letting you know if the number you are thinking of is bigger or smaller, than the one you guessed. The game will tell you to guess a number or a smaller number. This way the game will guide you to find the number.

5. If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts you will win the game.. If you do not guess the secret number correctly then the secret number will be revealed to you. This is what happens when you do not guess the number within the allowed attempts, for the secret number.

## Future Scope

- secret number**: The game can make up a new number each time you play so the game is more fun to play again and again with the **randomized secret number**.

- Difficulty levels**: We should let users pick the level of difficulty they want to play at. They can choose from Easy, Medium or Hard levels. The Easy level of the game will have a range of numbers and a lot of attempts to get it right. The Medium l
evel will have a range of numbers and fewer attempts. The Hard level will have a big range of numbers and very few attempts to get it right. This way users can play the game at their pace with Easy, Medium or Hard levels.

- Score system**: Keep track of scores based on attempts and accuracy.

- GUI version**: Create a graphical version using libraries like SDL or GTK.

- Multiplayer mode: This is where two players can play together. They can try to beat each other or take turns to guess something. The **Multiplayer mode** is really fun because two players can compete with each other or they can play together and take turns guessing in the **Multiplayer mode**.
